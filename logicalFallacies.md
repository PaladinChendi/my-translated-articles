# 你（thou 古时候的叫法）不应该犯逻辑谬误
### strawman
You misrepresented someone's argument to make it easier to attack.

By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument, it's much easier to present your own position as being reasonable, but this kind of dishonesty serves to undermine honest rational debate.

Example: After Will said that we should put more money into health and education, Warren responded by saying that he was surprised that Will hates our country so much that he wants to leave it defenceless by cutting military spending.

### 稻草人
你歪曲某人的论点使其更容易被攻击。

通过夸大，歪曲，或者完全地捏造某人的论点，这会更简单的合理表明你的立场，但是这种不诚实会破坏诚实理性的讨论。

例子：在Will说完我们应该把更多钱用在健康和教育领域之后，Warren回答说他非常惊讶Will如此讨厌我们的国家，以至于要削减军费开支来降低防御力。
