In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. It is not related to the GRASP software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.[1][2][3] Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.[3] The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns,[2][4] although the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.[5]

### Concepts
Single-responsibility principle[6]
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
Open–closed principle[7]
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
Liskov substitution principle[8]
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
Interface segregation principle[9]
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]
Dependency inversion principle[10]
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4]
